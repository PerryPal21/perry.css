## What does it do to your webpage
- makes it responsive
- makes it good looking with a theme that's easy on the eyes
- no classes, meaning no more ripping your hair out writing css for your projects

## How to use it

All you need to do to use is **drop the line of code below in your `<head>` tag**

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/PerryPal21/perry.css@master/perry.css">`

After that, **be sure to encase your html code in a div with a class of `container`**. It should ideally go after the body tags, to make the whole webpage responsive.

✨After that you will have yourself a fresh looking website✨
